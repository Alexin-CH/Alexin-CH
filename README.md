# Hi there! I'm Alexin 👨‍🔬🔬

## 🎓 Academic Profile
- 📡 **Machine Learning & Photonics Engineering Student**
- 🧠 Specializing in advanced computational optical systems and machine learning integration

## 🚀 Current Research & Projects
### Optical Diffractive Response Modeling

I'm currently working on a research project about **optical diffractive response modeling**, where I use ***RCWA*** and ***PyTorch*** to compute approximations of optical responses.
The goal is to combine this method with ***machine learning*** in order to enhance the *useability* and *precision* of the tool.

### Robotics Leadership

As the **President of University Robotics Team**, I am coordinating all teams to develop our robot for the ***'Coupe de France de Robotique'***. I'm currently working on **physics simulation**, **image processing**, and **robot control**.
